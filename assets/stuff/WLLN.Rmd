## Weak Law of Large Numbers

$$
\overline{X}_n \overset{P}{\to} \mu
$$
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{P}\left(\left|\overline{X}_n -\mu\right| > \epsilon \right) = 0
$$



## Chebyshev's Inequality

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(
\left|X-\mu\right| \geq k\sigma
\right) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}
$$



## Chebyshev's Inequality

Let $k=2$

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(
\left|X-\mu\right| \geq 2\sigma
\right) \leq \frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

i.e. the prob that **any** random variable lies outside 2 standard deviations of its mean is no more than 25%.
