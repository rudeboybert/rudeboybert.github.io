## Course Description and Objectives

This is an introductory probability and statistics class where a conceptual understanding of the material will be stressed.  Goals of this course include:

* Expose students to statistical concepts, including sampling, data visualizations, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression.
* Give students experience manipulating and analyzing data using the R statistical software package.
* Introduce the theory underlying statistics, including probability, distributions, the central limit theorem, etc.
* Develop statistical literacy.
* Tie in the curriculum to current events, demonstrating the importance statistics plays in society.
