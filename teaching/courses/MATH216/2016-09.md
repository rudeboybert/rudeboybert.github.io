## Course Description

In this course students will gain exposure to the entire data science pipeline: forming a statistical question, collecting and cleaning data sets, performing exploratory data analyses, identifying appropriate statistical techniques, and communicating the results, all the while leaning heavily on open source computational tools, in particular the R statistical software language. We will focus on analyzing real, messy, and large data sets, requiring the use of advanced data manipulation/wrangling and data visualization packages. Students will be required to bring their own laptops as many lectures will involve in-class computational activities.



## Learning Goals and Course Objectives

* College Writing
* Align how learning is done in practice.
* Differs from traditional stats, tacit knowledge, no right/wrong answers, only feedback


## Evaluation

**Item**  | **Weight** &nbsp; 
:------------- | :------------- 
Final Project &nbsp; | 60%  
Quizzes &nbsp; | 20% | 
5 Homeworks | 10% 
Engagement &nbsp; | 10% 



#### Homeworks

Over the course of the semester, you will be 

Each homework is worth only a nominal portion of the final grade. As such, 
instead of viewing them as evaluative tools used by the instructor to assign 
grades, they should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to develop one's data science 
toolbox and receive feedback on the progress of one's learning. 

Furthermore, collaboration on the homeworks is **highly** encouraged as in 
practice learning in many situations is best done in groups, especially when it
comes to coding. However, collaboration taken too far is copying. Not making an
honest effort on the homeworks will ultimately hurt you for your (individual) 
final project.

Details:

* Due on GitHub at 9am on the relevant Wednesday.
* **Honor code**: All collaborations must be explicity acknowledged at the beginning of your submissions.

#### Final Project

Much of this course is a build up to the final project, which is a capstone
experience synthesizing everything you've learned over the course of the
semester. There are 3 components to the total 50%

* Write-up 40%: Due on XXX
* Approximately 10 min oral presentation 15%: During the last 4 lectures with the presentation order determined at random a few weeks before. 
* Evaluation of your peers' final presentations 5%: You will be giving (anonymized) feedback on all presentations, on which you'll be graded
on the quality of your feedback.  


#### Quizzes

There will be a weekly quiz at the beginning of lecture on Mondays. The level of
these quizzes will be such that they don't require extensive studying; if you 
actively participate in class and are keeping up with the material, you will do
fine. Notes:

* It is your responsibility to be on time.
* There will be no makeup quizzes.
* The lowest two quiz scores will be dropped.


#### Engagement

It is difficult to explicity codify what constitutes "an engaged student", so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: **you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in**. Some examples of behavior counter to this
principle:

* Merely attending lectures and not participating in discussions.
* Leveraging previous experience in other settings to coast through this course.
* Not coming to office hours when the situation warrants it. 
* Submitting homework that has code or content that is copied from (or only
slightly modified versions of) your peers' work, going against the philosophy of
the homeworks being opportunities for practice and feedback, rather than as items 
to be graded on.



## Course Schedule

All problem sets and solutions will be posted either on

* the course [Moodle](http://moodle.middlebury.edu/course/view.php?id=2307) page
* the course [GitHub](https://github.com/Middlebury-Data-Science) page

## Materials

#### Textbook

There is no textbook to purchase; as much as possible, we will rely on open-source and freely available materials on the web.

#### Software

Instead of the desktop version of RStudio, we will be using the cloud-based RStudio Server interface, which you can access via [`go/rstudio`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/). Note if you are off-campus you must first log into the [Middlebury VPN](http://mediawiki.middlebury.edu/wiki/LIS/Off-campus_Access).  This choice was made for the following reasons:

* This spares me from software installation issue debugging, Mac vs Windows vs UNIX idiosyncracies.
* Dealing with computers with less processing power, as all the computation is done on Middlebury servers. 

If you'd rather work with a local version of RStudio, feel free to do so as I will provide rough instructions. 
However, I will not be providing tech support during the semester. Once the semester is over however, I'm 
happy to help with any installation issues. 










## Remarks

* **Academic accommodations for disabilities:**  Students with documented disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Assistance is available to eligible students through Student Accessibility Services. Please contact Jodi Litchfield, the ADA coordinator, at [litchfie@middlebury.edu](litchfie@middlebury.edu) or 802.443.5936 for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.
