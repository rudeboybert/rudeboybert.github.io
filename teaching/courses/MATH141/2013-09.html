<h2>Course Description/Goals</h2>
This is an introductory probability and statistics class intended for primarily for non-math majors.  As such, a conceptual understanding of the material will be stressed.  Goals of this course include
<ul>
	<li>Develop <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v10n3/rumsey2.html">statistical literacy</a>.</li>
	<li>Develop students' abilities to answer questions using data.</li>
	<li>To this end, give students experience manipulating and analyzing data using R, the widely used open source statistical software.</li>
	<li>Introduce the theory underlying statistics, including (but not limited to): probability, distributions, central limit theorem, etc.</li>
	<li>Expose students to basic statistical tools, including (but not limited to): sampling, visualizations of data, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression.</li>
	<li>Tie in the curriculum to current events, thus demonstrating the importance statistics plays in society.</li>
</ul>

</p>



<h2>Remarks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I encourage you to collaborate and discuss all problem sets with your peers.  Other resources such as Moodle discussion boards, other books, tutors, etc. are acceptable too.  However, your submissions should reflect your understanding of the material, and not be simple rewordings of another's work.  Furthermore, full disclosure of all collaborators and other help should be indicated.  If a problem is too hard, I'd still like to see a verbal description of what you do understand.
	</li>
	<li>Labs:  Other than the weekly quiz, learning R will be the primary focus of labs.  This is the best time to experiment and play with R, as the instructor will be present.  The more effort and initiative you put into labs, the easy doing the problem sets will be.</li>
	<li>Excused Absences:  there will be no make-up exams/quizzes, with the exception of serious illness, death in the immediate family, or religious obligations provided prior notice is given. </li>
	<li>Academic Accommodations for Disabilities: To request academic accommodations, due to disability, please contact <a href="http://www.reed.edu/disability_services/index.html">Disability Support Services</a>.</li>
