<h2>Remarks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Homeworks:  Late homework submissions will be accepted up to 2 days late with prior approval at a 25% penalty per day.  Unstapled homeworks will be penalized 25%.</li>
	<!--<li>I encourage you to collaborate and discuss all homeworks with your peers.  Other resources such as Moodle discussion boards, other books, tutors, etc. are acceptable too.  However, your submissions should reflect your understanding of the material, and not be simple rewordings of another's work.</li>-->
	<li>
	Tutoring:  The <a href="http://www.reed.edu/academic_support/tutor_schedule.html">DoJo</a> offers tutoring specifically for MATH 141.
		<ul>
			<li>Mondays 7-10PM</li>
			<li>Wednesdays 9-11PM</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Labs:  Other than the weekly quiz, learning R will be the primary focus of labs.  This is the best time to experiment and play with R, as the instructor will be present.  The more effort and initiative you put into labs, the easy doing the problem sets will be.</li>
	<li>Excused Absences:  there will be no make-up exams/quizzes, with the exception of serious illness, death in the immediate family, or religious obligations provided prior notice is given. </li>
