<h2>Remarks</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Homework policy</b>:
		<ul>
			<li>I encourage you to collaborate and discuss all homeworks with your peers.  Other resources such as other books, tutors, etc. are acceptable too.  However, your submissions should reflect your understanding of the material, and not be simple rewordings of another's work.</li>
			<li>You need to show all your work to receive full credit.</li>
			<li>Late homework submissions will be accepted up to 2 days late at a 25% penalty per day. If you submit late, you may not get it graded by the following week.</li>
			<li>Unstapled homeworks will be penalized 25%.</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Labs</b>:  Other than the weekly quiz, learning R will be the primary focus of labs.  This is the best time to experiment and play with R, as the instructor will be present.  The more effort and initiative you put into labs, the easy doing the problem sets will be.
	</li>
	<li><b>Absenses</b>:
		<ul>
			<li>You don't need to inform me of absences for lecture/lab. Please consult Moodle and your peers for what you missed.</li>
			<li>There will be no make-up exams/quizzes nor rescheduled exams, except in case of serious illness, death in the family, or religious obligations provided prior notice is given and documentation is provided.</li>
