<h2>Course Description/Goals</h2>
This is an advanced undergraduate level probability class where much of the material of this class will be the theoretical backbone of MATH 392: Mathematical Statistics.  Students will be exposed to a higher level of mathematical rigor.  Goals of this course include
<ul>
	<li> Defining probability using the Kolmogorov Axioms</li>
	<li> Giving a refresher on basic methods of counting, including permutations, combinations, and multinomial coefficients</li>
	<li> Understanding concepts of probability, including conditional probabilities and Bayes' Theorem </li>
	<li> Introducing both discrete and continuous random variables and their distribution functions</li>
	<li> Characterizing random variables via expectation, variance</li>
	<li> Understanding bivariate random variables: joint, marginal, covariance/correlation</li>
	<li> Studying two of the most important theorems in probability:  the Weak Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem</li>
	<li> Special topics (subject to change): Markov chains/Monte Carlo Methods, random processes, ...</li>
</ul>



<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<h2>Data at Reed</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://reed.edu/data-at-reed/">Data@Reed</a> is a new joint effort between the Library, CIS, and the DoJo to centralize data-related services for students, faculty, and staff.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reed.edu/cis/about/staff/majerus.html">Rich Majerus</a> (<a href="mailto:majerus@reed.edu">majerus@reed.edu</a>) is the Reed Instructional Technologist for Quantitative Applications who specializes in R.  Please use him as another resource.  His office hours are on Thursdays from 10-12 in ETC 223.</li>
<li>Data@Reed will be offering Data Skills Workshops over the course of the semester.  If you're interested in data management, ethics, learning more about R or STATA, and data visualization, check out their <a href="http://science.library.reed.edu/2014/data-skills-workshops/">schedule</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Moodle Page</h2>
All problem sets, solutions, and lecture notes will be posted on the <a href="https://moodle.reed.edu/course/view.php?id=2378">class Moodle page</a>.  Additionally, course announcements and discussion boards will be there.

<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>
<b>Textbook</b>: Statistical Inference by Casella and Berger.  This textbook is available in hardcover for sale at the Reed Bookstore or at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126">Amazon</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Software</b>:  The <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"> R statistical software package</a>, using the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> interface.  Homeworks have to be submitted using the R Markdown/knitr packages.  
</p>



<h2>Remarks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I encourage you to collaborate and discuss all problem sets with your peers.  Other resources such as Moodle discussion boards, other books, tutors, etc. are acceptable too.  However, your submissions should reflect your understanding of the material, and not be simple rewordings of another's work.  Furthermore, full disclosure of all collaborators and other help should be indicated.  If a problem is too hard, I'd still like to see a verbal description of what you do understand.
	</li>
	<li>Excused Absences:  there will be no make-up exams/quizzes, with the exception of serious illness, death in the immediate family, or religious obligations provided prior notice is given. </li>
	<li>Academic Accommodations for Disabilities: To request academic accommodations, due to disability, please contact <a href="http://www.reed.edu/disability_services/index.html">Disability Support Services</a>.</li>
