## Data and Code

The following are data and code for pedagogical purposes.

#### **`resampledata` R Package**

The `resampledata` R package consists of the data sets used in [Mathematical Statistics with Resampling in R](https://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/) (2011) by Laura Chihara and Tim Hesterberg.

* On [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=resampledata)
* On [GitHub](https://github.com/rudeboybert/resampledata)

#### **OkCupid Data**

[Data and code](https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid) for "OkCupid Profile
Data for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses" in the [Journal of 
Statistics Education July 2015, Volume 23, Number 
2](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v23n2/kim.pdf).

**Note**: there has been some 
[controversy](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/okcupid-study-reveals-perils-big-data-science/)
surrounding data of this sort. In our case, explicit permission was obtained
from OkCupid and usernames were not included in the data set.

#### **Reed College Jukebox Data**

All songs played on the [Reed College](http://www.reed.edu) jukebox located in
the pool room of the Commons building between November 30, 2003 and January 22,
2009.  The data was generously provided by [Noah Pepper 
'09](http://www.noahpepper.com/). The original data and code to generate a Shiny
webapp are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rudeboybert/ReedJukebox).

## Service

* **DataFest**: [DataFest](https://www.amstat.org/education/datafest/) is an
internationally coordinated undergraduate data analysis hackathon.
    + Along with Prof. Philip Yates I co-organized the inaugural [Vermont 802
    DataFest](datafest/datafest.html) at Saint Michael's College on April 8-10,
    2016.
    + I was a judge at the 2016 [Five College
    DataFest](http://www.science.smith.edu/datafest/) (UMass Amherst, Smith,
    Mount Holyoke, Amherst, Hampshire colleges) in Western Massachusetts.
* **OpenIntro Statistics**: I am a [contributing
volunteer](https://www.openintro.org/about.php) of [OpenIntro
Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php): a free and open-source
introductory statistics textbook.
* **Curricular Development**: I helped craft the Reed College [Mathematics Major
with Concentration in Statistics](http://www.reed.edu/math/requirements.html),
which debuted in the 2016-2017 academic year.
