## What is DataFest?

**DataFest is an internationally coordinated undergraduate data analysis hackathon.**

Over the course of a weekend, teams of students have to make sense of a large, 
rich, and complex dataset. At the end of the weekend, students will present 
their results to a panel of judges from local business, academia, and 
government, and have the chance to win prizes. Previous data sources include the
LAPD, eHarmony.com, and Edmunds.com.

Participating colleges this year include Duke, The Five Colleges (UMass Amherst,
Smith, Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Hampshire Colleges), Macalester, UC Berkeley,
The Ohio State University, Penn State University, and Vassar College.
