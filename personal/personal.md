## **Hobbies**

* My [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/22753418-albert?shelf=read&utm_medium=api) reading list.
* My (very incomplete) [AllTrails](http://www.alltrails.com/members/albert-kim/home) hiking/backcountry profile.
* I like beer; check out my
[Untappd](https://untappd.com/user/rudeboybert) profile for my ratings.
* I drive around Vermont a lot, necessitating podcasts to distract me. My two
favorite at the moment are:
    + [Judge John Hodgman](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/judge-john-hodgman): A fake internet courtroom podcast adjudicating on semantics and social norms. Example case: "Is a hotdog a sandwich?"
    + BBC Radio 4's [In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads) hosted by Melvyn Bragg.
