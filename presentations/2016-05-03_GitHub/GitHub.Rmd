## New Class: Intro to Data Science

<img src="figure/data_science.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>





## Demographics

**14 students**: 6 Seniors, 6 Juniors, & 2 Sophomores. Of which:

* **Double majors**:
    + Environmental Sciences-Econ
    + Econ-Linguistics
    + CS-Econ
* **Single majors**:
    + Economics x 4
    + Molecular Bio & Biochem x 3
    + International Politics and Econ, Neuroscience, Bio, CS





## Principles

* Mixture of lab & lecture: students bring their own laptops to class.
* Use real, messy, complex data.
* Discussions in class.
* This class uses R, but is not a class on R. I try to teach things in a
language agnostic fashion.
* ["Minimizing prerequisites to research."](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05346), quote by George Cobb.

## Data Science is like Writing Papers

Doing data analysis is part art/part science. There is

* **Substance**: what is trying to be said
* **Style**: how it is being said i.e. writing/coding

There is no instruction manual or code book for good writing/good data analysis.





## Motivation for this Talk

**Two goals**:

* Have students learn to code the way people learn in real life.
* Fascilitate giving feedback.

**Solution**:

* Lots of collaboration and peer learning.
* Homework as practice rather than evaluative.
* GitHub.




## GitHub

GitHub is a web based repository for code widely used by the open-source coding
community. It provides tools for

* Version control
* Collaboration

## How to give Feedback?

From a colleague in the humanities:

> **"Don't give feedback on everything. Focus on the top 5 things they need to work on, and drill down."**

Both for their sake and for your own.





## Example

Example of a student's recent [HW](https://github.com/Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-4/pull/11/files).





## Issues

The thing about GitHub...

* When it works, it works great.
* When it doesn't, its... [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1597/)
