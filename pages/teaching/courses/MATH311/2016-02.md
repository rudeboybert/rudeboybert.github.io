## Course Description

This is an advanced undergraduate level statistics class intended for those seeking a more in-depth treatment of the material.  The material from Probability MATH 310 serves as the theoretical underpinnings of this class.  Students will be exposed to a higher level of mathematical rigor than in a introductory probability and statistics class.  Topics in this course include

* Point estimation: methods of finding estimators and evaluating estimators
* Interval estimation
* Hypothesis testing: test construction, evaluation, and examples
* Asymptotics
* Linear models:  ANOVA, simple linear regression, generalized linear models.
* Bayesian inference
* Miscellaneous: Delta method, bootstrap methods, EM Algorithm




## Course Schedule

All problem sets and solutions will be posted on the course [Moodle](http://moodle.middlebury.edu/course/view.php?id=2308) page.

## Materials

* **Textbook**: Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R by Chihara and Hesterberg.
* **Software**: We will be using the R statistical software package via the RStudio Server integrated development environment, which you can access either
    + by installing it on your machines from the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) webpage. Note you will also need an installation of LaTeX.
    + via your web browser at [`https://rstudio.middlebury.edu`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/) (note the `https` and not `http`). If you are off-campus you must first log into the [Middlebury VPN](http://mediawiki.middlebury.edu/wiki/LIS/Off-campus_Access).

## Policies

* **Homeworks:**
    + Homeworks are due at the beginning of lecture.
    + Unstapled homeworks and those with the [kadoobies](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-name-for-the-scraps-of-paper-left-in-a-notebooks-spiral-after-tearing-out-a-page) will still attached will be penalized 25%.
    + Please do not email submissions; ask a classmate to print it for you.
    + Late submissions will be accepted up to 2 days after the due date at a 25% penalty per day. If you submit late, your graded homeworks might be returned late as well.
    + You need to show all your work to receive full credit.
* **Exams:**
    + There will be no make-up exams nor rescheduled exams, except in the following cases:
        + serious illness or death in the family only if documentation is provided.
        + athletic commitments or religious obligations only if documentation is provided and prior notice is given.
          In such cases, rescheduled exams must be taken **before** the rest of the class.
    + All midterms/exams might require a scientific calculator. Smartphone calculators will not be accepted.
* **Absences:**
    + There is no need to inform me of absences for lecture/lab. Please consult Moodle and your peers for what you missed.
* **Grading:**
    + If you feel there is a grading error, please resubmit the assignment in question with a post-it attached indicating the question and the error in question.
* **Honor code:**
    + While I encourage you to discuss homeworks with your peers, you must submit your own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work.  Furthermore, all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged on your submissions.
