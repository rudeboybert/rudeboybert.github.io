## Course Description

MATH 311 (Theory of) Statistics is the second course of a two-semester sequence
in probability and mathematical statistics. Given that MATH 310 Probability is a
pre-requisite for this class, students will be exposed to a higher level of
mathematical rigor than in a lower level statitics class. Furthermore, a working
knowledge of the R statistical software langauge will be assumed, opening up a
realm of resampling-based methods that are less accessible to students taking a
similar course but who lack experience with computing. Topics for this course
include:

* Concepts rooted in probability theory that are critical to statistics, such as
sampling distributions, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem.
* Traditional statistical theory and methods such as confidence intervals,
hypothesis testing, and point estimation (properties of, maximum likelihood,
method of moments).
* Resampling-based methods such as permutation tests and the Bootstrap.
* An overview of regression and Bayesian statistics.





## Course Schedule

All problem sets and solutions will be posted on the course [Moodle](http://moodle.middlebury.edu/course/view.php?id=2308) page.

## Materials

* **Textbook**: [Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118029852.html) by Chihara and Hesterberg. Textbook materials can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/home).
* **Software**: The [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) statistical software package via the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) integrated development environment. You can either
    + Install it on your own machines. Note you will also need an installation of LaTeX.
    + Use RStudio Server via your web browser at [`https://rstudio.middlebury.edu`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/) or [`go/rstudio`](http://go.middlebury.edu/rstudio). If you are off-campus you must first log into the [Middlebury VPN](http://mediawiki.middlebury.edu/wiki/LIS/Off-campus_Access).





## Evaluation

**Item**  | **Weight** &nbsp; | **Notes**
:------------- | :------------- | :-------------
3 Midterms | 60%  | One in-class, two evening.
Final Project/Exam &nbsp; | 25%  | Exact structure TBD.
Homeworks | 10% | HW assigned/due on Mondays.
Participation & Engagement &nbsp; | 5%  | 

#### Homeworks

Each homework counts for only a nominal portion of the final grade. As such:

* They should be viewed as opportunities to
    + receive feedback on the progress of one's learning, rather than as
    evalutations that require an explicit numerical grade.
    + practice for all midterms and in particular the final.
* Collaboration on the homeworks, both on the written and computational
components, is highly encouraged. See policy on homework collaboration below.
* Not all questions will be graded, but rather a subset of them. However, all
questions will have their solutions provided and are part of the material to be
covered for exams.





## Policies

* **Homeworks:**
    + Due at the beginning of class. Late homeworks/extensions will not be accepted/granted.
    + Homeworks that are unstapled and have the [kadoobies](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-name-for-the-scraps-of-paper-left-in-a-notebooks-spiral-after-tearing-out-a-page) still attached will not be accepted.
    + Please do not email submissions if you can't make it to class; ask a classmate to submit it for you.
    + All collaborations **must be explicity acknowledged** at the beginning of your submissions.
* **Exams:**
    + There will be no make-up/rescheduled exams, except in the following cases:
        + serious illness or death in the family only if documentation is provided.
        + athletic commitments or religious obligations only if documentation is provided and prior notice is given.
          In such cases, rescheduled exams must be taken **before** the rest of the class.
    + All exams might require a scientific calculator. Smartphone calculators will not be accepted.
* **Email:**
    + I much prefer answering questions in person during office hours than by email, as I'll have a much easier time diagnosing the question and can offer better answers. Furthermore, this fascilitates the transfer of [tacit knowledge](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+tacit+knowledge&oq=define+tacit+kno&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l2.2735j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8).
* **Absences:**
    + There is no need to inform me of absences. Please consult Moodle and your peers for what you missed.

#### Honor Code

1. See policy on homework collaboration above.
2. All exams will be closed book and closed notes with no consulting, unless otherwise specified.
3. The Honor Code Statement must be written and signed on each exam.
4. I expect you to take the Honor System and intellectual honesty very seriously.





## Remarks

* **Academic accommodations for disabilities:**  Students with documented disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Assistance is available to eligible students through Student Accessibility Services. Please contact Jodi Litchfield, the ADA coordinator, at [litchfie@middlebury.edu](litchfie@middlebury.edu) or 802.443.5936 for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.
