## Course Description

In this course students will gain exposure to the entire data science pipeline: forming a statistical question, collecting and cleaning data sets, performing exploratory data analyses, identifying appropriate statistical techniques, and communicating the results, all the while leaning heavily on open source computational tools, in particular the R statistical software language. We will focus on analyzing real, messy, and large data sets, requiring the use of advanced data manipulation/wrangling and data visualization packages. Students will be required to bring their own laptops as many lectures will involve in-class computational activities. (MATH 0116; or ECON 0210 or PSYC 0201 and experience with R) 3 hrs lect./disc.

## Policies

* **Homeworks:**
    + Late submissions will be accepted up to 2 days after the due date at a 25% penalty per day. If you submit late, your graded homeworks might be returned late as well.
* **Absences:**
    + There is no need to inform me of absences for lecture/lab. Please consult Moodle and your peers for what you missed.
* **Honor code:**
    + While I encourage you to discuss homeworks with your peers, you must submit your own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work.  Furthermore, all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged on your submissions.
* **Academic accommodations for disabilities:**  Students with documented disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Assistance is available to eligible students through Student Accessibility Services. Please contact Jodi Litchfield, the ADA coordinator, at [litchfie@middlebury.edu](litchfie@middlebury.edu) or 802.443.5936 for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.
