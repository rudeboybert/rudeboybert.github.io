    + by installing it on your machines from the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) webpage. Note you will also need an installation of LaTeX.
    + via your web browser at [`https://rstudio.middlebury.edu`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/) (note the `https` and not `http`). If you are off-campus you must first log into the [Middlebury VPN](http://mediawiki.middlebury.edu/wiki/LIS/Off-campus_Access).
